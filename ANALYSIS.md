# Spartan Layout Analysis

## Project Info
- **Client:** Spartan Transport
- **Address:** 101 Mark St Suite E, Wood Dale, IL 60191
- **Clear Height:** 24'
- **Pallet Size:** 40" x 48"
- **Pallet Weight:** 3,000#
- **Total:** 2,658 Pallet Positions (Selective Rack, 11'-7" typical aisle)
- **Drawing:** v1.2, drawn by TR, 12/5/25, Project No. 2024-26

## PDF Structure (3 pages)
- **Page 1:** Bird's eye layout with bay type key (A, B, C) + side elevation views
- **Page 2:** Bird's eye layout (zoomed/detailed) showing bay type grid
- **Page 3:** Side elevation detail views for types A, B, C

## Bay Types (from elevations)

### Type A - 1,236 Pallet Positions
- Side view shows: multiple beam levels
- Dimensions: 22'-0" [264"] total height area, with beam levels
- Beam spacing shown in elevation

### Type B - 910 Pallet Positions
- Different beam configuration
- Uses 11'-7" [139"] spacing references

### Type C - 512 Pallet Positions
- Tallest configuration (34'-11" [419"] or similar)
- Different beam level spacing

## Key Observations
- Bay types A, B, C are labeled on the floor plan grid
- Each bay type has a corresponding RACK ELEVATION (side view)
- Side views show beam levels, pallet positions, and dimensions
- The grid layout shows rows of letters indicating bay type assignments

## Dimensions Found
- Beam lengths appear to include: 44", 46", 54", 66", 92", 108", 132", 138", 162", 184", 198", 216", 230", 264"
- Upright heights: 139", 184", 270", 406", 419"
- Beam level spacings: 4'-6" [54"] repeated sections
- Aisle width: 11'-7" typical
